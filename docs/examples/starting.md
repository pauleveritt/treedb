# Starting

Let's make a little starting point.
In this app, we have a `Root` resource.
Then, there is a `RootView` that will render it.

```{literalinclude} ../../examples/starting/__init__.py
```

- Run it once with a value of `title`
- Change the value of `root.title`
- Run it again, we get the new value
